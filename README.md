# Single molecule tools (Alex Payne-Dwyer)

Forked from single-molecule-tools (authors Adam Wollman and Isabel Llorente-Garcia); See [website](https://awollman.github.io/single-molecule-tools/).  This comprises a series of Matlab functions and scripts for tracking and quantification of spots in images, deconvolution, segmentation and simulation. Also capable of estimating single molecule concentrations from volumetric models and 2D images.  Useful for localisation microscopy, step-wise photobleaching, STORM, PALM, SHRIMP, FRAP and regular fluorescence microscopy data.  

Novel functionality here includes distribution-based estimates of periodic clustering in molecular assemblies, as well as handy scripts for visualising correlated properties of trajectories colocalised across two channels.

Useful if you want to update the repository directly from Matlab or contribute to it but not necessary.
